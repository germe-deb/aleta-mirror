# Setup inkscape
* import the inkscape palette in the Tools folder. how?:
* copy other/aleta-inkscape.gpl to:
* flatpak inkscape version: `~/.var/app/org.inkscape.Inkscape/config/inkscape/palettes`
* native inkscape version: `~/.config/inkscape/palettes`.

# Design

* the position of the icon will fit in the hints.
* the drawing must be white.
* the final icon must be only paths.
* the minimal width is a square of the grid. preferably make -2 squares lines- as minimum.
* if the icon is complex, simplify it,
* please use a color that is aproximated to the original; if the original icon shows many colors, decide by yourself what are the best color to use.

## folder design

* instead of the template.svg, use the template-folder.svg.
* in that template are two hints more; they are for the subicon.
        * the pink is the limit of the icon.
        * the red is the limit of the icon's stroke.

# subicons and folder

* the subicon of an icon that use the subicon template need to have a stroke of 1 px, the same color of the background, the order: "makers, stroke, fill", and it need to be converted to path.
