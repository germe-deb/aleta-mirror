# Aleta Postre 

### A material icon pack featuring gradients, squares, and white symbolics!

![aleta](https://gitea.sergiotarxz.freemyip.com/germedeb/aleta-postre/raw/branch/master/other/images/presentation-beta.png)

This icon pack is strongly inspired in moka and ameixa, and a bit in adwaita.

Now we are working in the redesign of the icon pack, and adding new apps to the list of icons.
